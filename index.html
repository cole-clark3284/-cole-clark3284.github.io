                <h2>Lots of Comics</h2>

                    <p>

                        We sell a lot of different comics. From rare atiques to ones that came out today. 
                        Do keep in mind, the older comics are reprints so that we can keep the price down.
                        You can buy from an inperson place or amazon but we have the best prices and we price match
                        (which is done manually so please don't over do it). We are a family owned company that aims
                        to be well known and the talk on the playground.

                    </p>

                                From atiques to ones that came out today. Our earilest comic is X-men comic that was 
                                The Yellow Kid in McFadden's Flats published in 1897. To Nightwing #95 which was 
                                released on August 16th, 2022.

                            <dd>
    
                                All older copies that where not released recently are reprinted to order. We
                                try our hardest to give older comics the old feel of what they where when they 
                                first came out.
